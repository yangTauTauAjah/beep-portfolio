departments (id, organization_id, name, description, head_id)
committees (id, department_id, name, description, chair_id)

-- User and member management
users (id, name, email, password, role, status, created_at)
members (id, user_id, student_id, department_id, join_date, status)
profiles (id, user_id, bio, avatar, social_links, created_at)

-- Content management
posts (id, title, content, author_id, category_id, status, published_at)
categories (id, name, description, slug)
media (id, filename, original_name, mime_type, size, path)

-- Events and activities
events (id, title, description, start_date, end_date, location, organizer_id)
event_registrations (id, event_id, user_id, status, registered_at)
```
