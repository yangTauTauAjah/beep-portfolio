## Overview

A comprehensive full-stack movie application that allows users to browse, search, and discover movies. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and featuring Ant Design for a polished user interface. This project demonstrates the complete development cycle of a modern web application, from database design to user interface implementation.

The application serves as a movie discovery platform where users can explore films by various criteria including genre, popularity, and release date. The backend API provides robust data management capabilities, while the frontend delivers an intuitive and responsive user experience. User authentication and personalization features allow for customized movie recommendations and watchlist management, creating a personalized entertainment hub for movie enthusiasts.

## Key Features
