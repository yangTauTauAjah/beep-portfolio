<!-- Example of responsive component structure -->
<template>
  <div class="nft-marketplace">
    <!-- Mobile Navigation -->
    <MobileNav v-if="$screen.lt.md" />
    
    <!-- Desktop Sidebar -->
    <DesktopSidebar v-else />
    
    <!-- Main Content -->
    <main class="main-content">
      <NFTGrid :nfts="nfts" />
    </main>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.nft-marketplace {
  @apply flex min-h-screen;
}

.main-content {
  @apply flex-1 p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8;
}

/* Responsive breakpoints */
