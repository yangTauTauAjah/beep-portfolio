## Overview

A comprehensive todo application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and featuring a clean, responsive interface for optimal productivity. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of full-stack development while creating a practical tool for personal and professional task management.

The application provides a complete task management solution with user authentication, allowing individuals to organize their daily activities, set priorities, and track progress. The intuitive interface makes it easy to create, edit, and categorize tasks, while the responsive design ensures accessibility across all devices. The backend API handles data persistence and user management, creating a seamless experience for users to maintain their productivity workflows.

## Key Features

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Task Categories**: Organize tasks by categories and priorities
- **Due Date Tracking**: Set and track task deadlines
- **Search and Filter**: Find tasks quickly with search and filter options
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface for on-the-go task management
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are saved and synchronized across devices
- **User Profiles**: Personalized user accounts with task history

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building interactive components
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for API development
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage
- **Native JavaScript**: Core functionality and DOM manipulation
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with responsive design principles
- **JWT**: Authentication and authorization
- **REST API**: Backend API for data communication

## Backend Features

The application includes a robust backend with:
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- User authentication and session management
- Database integration with MongoDB
- Data validation and sanitization
- Error handling and logging
- Security measures and input validation

## Frontend Features

The React frontend provides:
- Intuitive task management interface
- Real-time updates and synchronization
- Responsive design for all devices
- User-friendly forms and validation
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessibility features for inclusive design

## Database Schema

The MongoDB database includes collections for:
- Users (authentication and profile data)
- Tasks (todo items with metadata)
- Categories (task organization)
- User sessions (authentication tokens)

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a full-stack todo application required understanding data persistence and user experience design. Implementing real-time synchronization and managing application state were key challenges. Learning to work with databases and API development provided valuable experience in full-stack development.

## Outcome

The FullStack Todo App successfully demonstrates the capabilities of the MERN stack in building practical web applications. The project showcases modern full-stack development practices and serves as a foundation for understanding database-driven applications.
